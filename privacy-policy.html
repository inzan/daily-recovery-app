 <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
 <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 2025</p>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Daily Recovery ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

 <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
 <p>We want to be clear that we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers. All data, including:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>Prayer recordings and transcriptions</li>
     <li>Streak counts and progress data</li>
     <li>Prayer completion history</li>
     <li>App settings and preferences</li>
 </ul>
 <p>is stored locally on your device and is not accessible by us or any third parties.</p>

 <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
 <p>The App stores all information locally on your device using:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>Apple's SwiftData framework for prayer records</li>
     <li>UserDefaults for app preferences and streak data</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This data remains on your device and is only accessible through your App installation.</p>

 <h2>Speech Recognition</h2>
 <p>The App uses Apple's Speech Recognition framework for prayer practice. This processing is performed on-device and we do not store or transmit any audio recordings or transcriptions to external servers.</p>

 <h2>Notifications</h2>
 <p>If you enable notifications, these are scheduled locally on your device. We do not use any external notification services or collect any information about your notification preferences.</p>

 <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
 <p>We do not use any analytics services or tracking mechanisms. We have no ability to track your usage of the App or collect any usage statistics.</p>

 <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
 <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>Delete all app data by using the reset function in the developer settings</li>
     <li>Remove all data by uninstalling the App</li>
     <li>Manage individual prayer records within the App</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
 <p>The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

 <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
 <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

 <h2>Your Consent</h2>
 <p>By using our App, you consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

 <h2>Contact Us</h2>
 <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the App Store page for Daily Recovery.</p>

 <h2>Anonymity and Recovery</h2>
 <p>We understand and respect the importance of anonymity in recovery programs. Our App is designed to support your recovery journey while maintaining your privacy and anonymity. We do not collect, store, or share any information that could identify you or your participation in any recovery program.</p>
